Structure of $0C00

$0C00 is called twice during the main game loop.

First call at $1452 with A=0: this is the full version

Second call can be in one of three places:
   A. $148B with A=$80 if player issues non-direction command
   OR B. $1475 with A=$80 if bit 7 of $2AD0 is NOT set
   OR C. $146A with A=$80 if direction command and bit 7 is set
