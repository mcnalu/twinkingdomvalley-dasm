Structure of $0C00

$0C00 is called twice during the main game loop.

First call at $1452 with A=0: this is the full version

Second call can be in one of three places:
   A. $148B with A=$80 if player issues non-direction command
   OR B. $1475 with A=$80 if bit 7 of $2AD0 is NOT set
   OR C. $146A with A=$80 if direction command and bit 7 is set
   
$15 is set to A at $0C00. If bit 7 then branches to $0CAE skipping most of routine.

Note: $15 is also set to $80 during full run of $0C00 at $0C98.

##SECOND call structure

JSR $0C00 with A=$80 so ?$15=$80
JMP $0CAE near start

$0CB2 loop: check if NPCs at player's location attack or pick up but NPC cannot
            act if bit 6 of player is set.
$0CC3 loop: move NPCs

##FIRST call structure

JSR $0C00 with A=$0 so ?$15=$0

Print magenta dashes to indicate start of new turn.
Call to $42A0 set players new location $89 and handles special events
$0C1E loop :clears all but bit 7 from $2AD0 to $2AD0+25=$2AF5 inclusive
           :these are used to store status of characters inc player during turn

$0C2D loop :first outer loop of NPCs in X calling $0CDE each time
            do combat, pickups and decide movements - details below
            (see third loop for affect of bit 7 of $15)

$0C37 loop :second outer loop to print out info on NPCs in same location as player 
            (see third loop for affect of bit 7 of $15)

$0C78 loop :calls $229F to get user input and process into commands

$0CA0 loop :third outer loop but not ?$15=$80
            only calls $0CD9 if NPC is at player's (previous?) location
            For each NPC for which $0CD9 is called:
              Because bit 7 of $15 is set:
                 bit 7 of $2AD0 for each NPC is cleared
                 results of attacks are printed out at player location
                 transfers of objects are done
                 
$0CAD RTS from $0C00

$0C2D loop details:
            $0CEE is called for all non-dead NPCs
              $15>=0 so $2AD0 bit 7s are as they were from previous turn
              $18 set from $2880 table and $19 from $28A0
              Two cases decided between just after $D01:
              A Char has zero $18 and $19:
                EITHER JMP to $0E5B if there are hostiles present then RTS
                OR JMP to $0E99 to pick up weapons then RTS
              B Char has non-zero $18 or non-zero $19 then branch to $0D22:
                  If no hostiles branch to $0D6E:
                     Try to pick up:
                       If something picked up then RTS
                       If nothing:
                          If ?$19!=0 then branch to $D3D to do movement
                          If ?$19==0 then randomly then
                            EITHER RTS
                            OR Branch to $0DB9 to random move and RTS
                  If hostiles then:
                    EITHER I  if ?$19=0 then JSR $0E5B to handle combat then branch to $0D36:
                                JSR $E5B to handle combat and picking up of weapons
                                If nothing happened branch to $0DB9 to random move and RTS
                                If attack or pickup occurred then try movement in $0D3D
                    OR     II if ?$19!=0 then if NPC's $2AD0 bit 7 set then branch to $0D55:
                                  try to move and if move possible record in 2BD0 and RTS
                                  if move not possible then do option I
